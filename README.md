# ElastAlert2Rules

- We have no money and we dont want to use money for just a 2 pages paper
- Which means we cant use webhooking feature in Kibana
- So we got to use ElastAlert2

- Problem 1. We cant use rules that we activated in Kibana via ElastAlert2\n
- Problem 2. YOU have to set your own yaml file rules for ElastAlert2
- Problem 3. Its kinda boring ass job

- Solution: This repo, will provide you the yaml file for ElastAlert2. So you can just use git clone in somewhere VM, and give it to ElastAlert2
